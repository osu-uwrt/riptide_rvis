# riptide_rviz

This is a ROS2 package designed around controlling the OSU-UWRT Ritpide software stack onboard our robot. 
The plugin set is able to start code on remote computers, control the state of the vehicle, manipulate onboard actuators, 
visualize and execute autonomous behavior, and display important telemetry in a centralized location for an operator.

This is the configuration that is saved with the repo. This configurations in only reccomended, but can be modified as needed.
